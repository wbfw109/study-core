    Time Complexity (Worst-case): O( BFS(maze) ) (but some routes with key subsets are added.)

    Space Complexity (Worst-case): O( BFS(maze) )

    Implementation
        - It uses Masking.
        - Things I've done in the implementation.
            - If I create new n*m boolean table whenever new key is obtained
                , it occurs "Memory Limit Exceeded".
            - When I use heapq instead of deque to eliminate some duplicated exploration that it occured because BFS still proceeds one by one
                , this rather causes "Timeout" because of time complexity of heapq.
                I had used max heap with bit count of <key_state>.
        - ‚ùì It seems that implementation using 3D trace_map by subset of keys is faster than current implementation to compare subset
            , because comparsing subsets (latter) is expensive than aloowing some duplicated exploration (former).

            - the Optimized value may exist or not in given Array
                Assume that the value is between consecutive two values in the Array.
                To determine which values minimize Abs
                üö£, It should test both; each sum of (the control variable, one of consecutive two values)

    Purpose
        - to compare absolute sums of two solution by explicitly control two index pointers with exclusive range.

    Consideration
        - ‚ùî How do I compose up inside of the loop?
            chaining one by one in order to test sum of solution, one loop must have one predicate.

    Implementation
        - even if I implement by using Binary Search
            , since purpose is testing sum of two solution rather than searching one target
            , Anyway after Binary search it must be tested in condition where fixed one control variable (unmodified) and modify another variable.
            so Binary Search useless.
        - if list of solution is sorted state, It can calculate systematically all solution in order.
            if <temp_sum> is less than zero, two selections exist: increase (<left_i> | <right_i>).
            but <right_i> starts with end of the list, so it doesn't have to be bothered.

    Definition
        - Number( BFS(islands) ): |V| + |E|; Time occurred to distinguish islands in given 10*10 grid

    Purpose
        - to get minimum length of bridges to route all islands.

        - given map uses numbers (0, 1) to represent OCEAN and ISLAND. so be careful when numbering islands.

    Implementation
        - Used data structure: adjacent list in BFS
        - I used Kruscal's algorithm to get optimized path (Minimum Spanning Tree).
            - used Find function of Union-find: Halving
        - Things I've done if adjacent islands (4 directions) of bridges are included in "connection"
            - BFS to constructable bridges in one depth, and simulate combinations with (1 ~ the number of edges)
                , even if duplicated bridges are chose.

            <track> in class <RouteState> is used instead of hash table that indicates whether cell is explored.
            even if <track> is same but actual route is different at some point, it doesn't matter.
            purpose is <maximum_passing_distance> and these <RouteState> can't invade each other's path in according to given condition.
        - Used data structure: array for reducing memory usage.
        - DFS non-recursive implementation was evaluated as Timeout (slow) because DFS must be backtracking and it's cost is expensive.
            If the size of the board increases, the number of cases to be tracked increases exponentially.

    Time Complexity (Worst-case): ...

        - O(n*m) in BFS loop
            operations to realign locations of marbles.

    Space Complexity (Worst-case): O(1) from BFS at least
        - 1 is element in queue to indicates initial state

    Definition
        - LAST_TURN: 10. the number of maximum turns.
        - Number(directions): 4. (left, right, down, up). available motions in every turn.
        - n, m: size to create marble board (n*m grid).
        - Number( BFS(board_for_marble) ): |V| + |E|; Time occurred from branching as many Number(directions) until turn 10
            - the number of (blue, red) marbles points are vertexes
            - sum of Number(directions) from each turn (1 ~ 9 turns) are edges.

    Consideration
        ‚ùî Where should I put the code for determining the win or loss (failure or continuation) of the game and the code for early termination?
            - for faster exit game, I compared locations of hole and marbles by line. not by block.
                and I used try ~ except statement in order to break nested loop once.
        - Even if blue marble falls into the hole (failure), It should not raise GameEnd exception to immediately break all loops
            , because remained cases are still not tested.

    Implementation
        - Used data structure: array for reducing memory usage.
        - Used data structure: deque in BFS.
            branches (2d array) are created by assemble elements of original 2d array.
            but in this problem, it should trace blue and red marble point to avoid duplicated exploration.
            so I used the way that assemble original 2d array and reassemble to recover original 2d array.
            this makes that code to process in the iterator can have consistency.
        - I made the class <MarblesPoint> hashable to compare faster whether the same marble points are in <explored_marbles_points> or not.

    Implementation
        - Used data structure: stack in DFS using <dfs_stack_by_turn>

            but a variable to verify it has been explored is not required.

        - when calculates numbers, to transpose calculated board to true location of cells doesn't matter.
            because this can be thought of as a transposed and sorted matrix
            , and branch types in each branch is same. (Number(directions))

    Definition
        - n: size to create marine space (n*n grid).
        - Number( BFS(available_cells) ): |V| + |E|; Time occurred from available cells where baby shark can pass through in given n*n space
            - available cells are vertexes
            - adjacent available cells of a available cell are edges (up to 4 directions in each the cell)
        - Number(baby_shark): The number of virus cells in given n*n grid before virus cells spread.
            given value is fixed as one.

    Purpose
        - Simulate: situation where baby shark moves in optimized path step by step and by distance.

    Consideration
        - Baby shark starts with 2 size and size is increased in +1 if prey on fishes as many the number of current baby shark's size
        - Baby shark can only move in directions: (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)
        - Baby shark can only prey on fishes that have a size less than baby shark's size.
        - Baby shark can only pass through fishes that have a size equal or less than baby shark's size.
        - Precedence of fishes to be preyed on
            - smaller (distance, row, column)
        - Each cell in marine space have 0 ~ 1 number of fish that have a size.
        - Baby Shark is only one in the marine space.

    Implementation
        - Used data structure: deque in BFS
            It uses BFS every time that baby shark prey on a fish until baby shark can not prey on fish.
            : the number of remained fishes are 0  |  all size of remained fishes is bigger than baby shark.
        - It is divided in main two step.
            1. explore toward each directions from explored points (initial point is baby shark's point)
                , and collect next exploration points.
                According to the given conditions of what fish to be predated
                , there is no need to navigate all the map space each time to search the fish.
            2. analyze next exploration points.
            2.1. if fishes that baby shark can prey on exist, baby shark preys on one of fishes by the precedence.
            2.2. else, re-run "1" step.

        - n, m: size to create space of laboratory (n*m grid).
        - Combinations(empty_cells): The number of combinations in which 3 empty cells are replaced with wall cell.
        - Number(empty_cells): The number of empty cells in given n*m grid.
        - Number(given_virus_cell): The number of virus cells in given n*m grid before virus cells spread.
        - Number( BFS(spread_virus_cells) ): |V| + |E|; Time occurred from spread virus cells including given virus cells in given n*m grid
            - spread virus cells are vertexes
            - adjacent virus cells of a virus cell are edges (up to 4 directions in each the cell)

    Purpose
        - Simulate: situations for each available combination where given all walls are constructed.
            and select maximum number of empty cells.

    Consideration
        - ‚ùî Are there cases where walls can not be constructed because there is not enough empty cell?
            No. minimum the number of empty cell is 3 in given condition.
        - Virus cell can only spread in directions: (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)

    Implementation
        - Used data structure: deque in BFS (It can be also implemented by using DFS.)
            It uses BFS that visits from right edges to left edge (except initial deque) for each initial virus entry points.
        - If points and cell in given space are represented as NamedTuple and Enum type,
            , it causes considerable delay because this algorithm calculates many operations for each simulated case.
        - This solution does not require <is_explored> variable in BFS.
            because virus cells are input in deque before explore, and spread one by one
            , and the condition of spread is that it judges whether adjacent cells are only empty cells
            , but operations to do in other branch of condition is none.
        - It uses list for backtracking to recover changed cell types for each simulation.
            because cost of deep copy is expensive, especially in combinations loop.
        - Brute-force makes sense; itertools.combinations
        - It can be also implemented in the way like event propagation, but it is slower 2 times than current implementation.
            before explore in a direction, filter some directions of surrounding points toward the wall points
            , and if edge points, filter some directions in order to prevent the out of range.
            , and copy this original <explored_directions_space> and use copied variable
            , and after virus_entry_point.get(), filter some directions of surrounding points toward the entry point.

    Space Complexity (Worst-case): O(n) + O(k) from Tim sort

    Definition
        - n: the number of jewels.
        - k: the number of bags.

    Purpose
        - to maximize value of jewels, a bag should select available Jewel with highest value in each iteration.

    Consideration
        - One bag can select a unique Jewel.
        - ‚ùî should I check all available Jewels in every bag?
            Inefficient. in the case, if a bag select a jewel it should updates all available Jewels in remained bag.
        - ‚ùî Which bag should I check a jewel first?
            If a bag with a large allowance is first, it is difficult to choose jewel for a smaller bag.
        - When the number of bag is greater than jewel.

    Implementation
        - Used data structure: Heap
            - Min heap for Jewels.
            - Max heap for available values of Jewels by bag through ad-hoc.
        - To explore <jewel_list> and <bag_list> sorted in ascending order makes that:
            - Once explored jewel's weight will be not important in remained bag's iteration.
                because any added jewel into Max heap can be put in any remained bags.
        - This problem is variant of Knapsack problem.
