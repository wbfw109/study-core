    Variables:
        - <sequence>: X.
        - <predecessor_indexes>: P.
            P stores the index of the predecessor of X[k] in the longest increasing subsequence ending at X[K]
        - <smallest_indexes_at_l>: M.
            M stores the index k of the smallest value X[k] such that there is an increasing subsequence of length l ending at X[k] in the range k ‚â§ i.
            üö£ One of <smallest_indexes_at_l> could be updated whenever evaluate X[K].
                but Note that <longest_increasing_subsequence> is created only from last index of <found_subsequence_l> by tracing <predecessor_indexes>
                , which means creatable increasing subsequences ending at length l in <smallest_indexes_at_l> are independent.
            üö£ It uses binary search with custom predicate to find <new_l> for X[K.]
        - <longest_increasing_subsequence>: S (permutation (set)).
        - <found_subsequence_l>: L (length of Longest Increasing Subsequence).
        - <new_l>: l (suitable length for X[i]. 1 ‚â§ l ‚â§ L)
            Target of Binary search (== <mid>): smallest positive l such that X[M[l]] > X[i]

    Detail of Binary search used in this implementation: ‚û°Ô∏è
        üîç It seems that there is no duplicate calculation of the <mid>
        , because the loop is performed and broken out when <high - low> is less than 2.

        Note that range of Binary search (lo, high) is inclusive that could be set.
