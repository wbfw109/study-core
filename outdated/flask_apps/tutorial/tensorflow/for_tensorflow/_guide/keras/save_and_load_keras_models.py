# * Introduction
"""
A Keras model consists of multiple components:
    - The architecture, or configuration, which specifies what layers the model contain, and how they're connected.
    - A set of weights values (the "state of the model").
    - An optimizer (defined by compiling the model).
    - A set of losses and metrics (defined by compiling the model or calling add_loss() or add_metric()).

The Keras API makes it possible to save all of these pieces to disk at once, or to only selectively save some of them:
    - Saving everything into a single archive in the TensorFlow SavedModel format (or in the older Keras H5 format). This is the standard practice.
    - Saving the architecture / configuration only, typically as a JSON file.
    - Saving the weights values only. This is generally used when training the model.

; H5 format "in the older Keras H5 format"

# * Setup
TEST_PATH = Path.home() / "test"
TEST_PATH.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Saving a Keras model:
# model = keras.models.Sequential()
# model.save(TEST_PATH)

# Loading the model back:
model = keras.models.load_model(
    str(SAVED_FOLDER_PATH / "model-CNN"), custom_objects={"AdaBound": AdaBound}
)

"""
You can save an entire model to a single artifact. It will include:
    - The model's architecture/config
    - The model's weight values (which were learned during training)
    - The model's compilation information (if compile() was called)
    - The optimizer and its state, if any (this enables you to restart training where you left)

APIs
    - model.save() or tf.keras.models.save_model()
    - tf.keras.models.load_model()

There are two formats you can use to save an entire model to disk: the TensorFlow SavedModel format, and the older Keras H5 format.

note: ‚óè The recommended format is SavedModel. It is the default when you use model.save().
