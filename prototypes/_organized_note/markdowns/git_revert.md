In the given situation, if you run `git revert C` to revert from commit C to commit B, here’s how the working directory and staging area will look.
# Difference between `git reset` and `git revert`

| Component               | **`git reset --soft`**                            | **`git reset --mixed`**                          | **`git reset --hard`**                           | **`git revert`**                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **`HEAD` pointer**       | Moves to the specified commit                    | Moves to the specified commit                    | Moves to the specified commit                    | **Creates a new commit after the specified commit** |
| **Commit History**       | **Commits after the specified commit are deleted** | **Commits after the specified commit are deleted** | **Commits after the specified commit are deleted** | **Commit history is retained**, new commit is added |
| **Staging Area (Index)** | **Unchanged**                                    | Resets to the state of the specified commit, all files are **unstaged** | Resets to the state of the specified commit, all files are **unstaged** | **Staging area must be clean** before the revert operation |
| **Working Directory**    | **Unchanged**                                    | **Unchanged**                                   | **Resets completely to the state of the specified commit** | **Unchanged**                                   |
| **Recoverability**       | **Commits are deleted**, **cannot be recovered**  | **Commits are deleted**, **cannot be recovered**  | **Commits are deleted**, **cannot be recovered**  | Commit is retained, **can always be restored**  |
| **Action**               | **Resets to the specified commit and deletes**   | **Resets to the specified commit and deletes**   | **Resets to the specified commit and deletes**   | **Reverts the changes of the specified commit by creating a new commit** |

## Key Differences Explained

1. **Commit History Handling**:
   - **`git reset`**: Commits after the specified commit are **completely deleted**. These changes are removed from the commit history.
   - **`git revert`**: A new commit is created that **reverts the changes** from the specified commit, while the previous commit history remains intact.

2. **Staging Area Handling**:
   - **`git reset`**: Depending on the option (`--soft`, `--mixed`, `--hard`), the staging area may be unchanged, reset, or cleared.
   - **`git revert`**: The revert operation requires a **clean staging area**. Staged changes must be committed or stashed before performing a revert. The staging area itself is not affected by the revert process.

3. **Action Type**:
   - **`git reset`**: Resets the commit history and **deletes** the changes after the specified commit. The effect on the **staging area** and **working directory** varies depending on the option (`--soft`, `--mixed`, `--hard`).
   - **`git revert`**: Instead of deleting the commit history, it **creates a new commit** that undoes the changes in the specified commit, preserving all previous history.

### Example:

#### `git reset` example:
```bash
A---B---C---D (HEAD)
```
After running `git reset --hard B`:
```bash
A---B (HEAD)
```
- Commits `C` and `D` are **completely deleted**.
- **Cannot be recovered**.

#### `git revert` example:
```bash
A---B---C---D (HEAD)
```
After running `git revert C`:
```bash
A---B---C---D---C' (HEAD)
```
- A new commit `C'` is created to undo the changes from commit `C`.
- Commit history is preserved.


    ## Scenario setup:
    - **Commit A**: `.gitignore` file is created.
    - **Commit B**: 
    - `hello.txt` file is created (content: "hello").
    - `world.txt` file is created (content: "World").
    - **Commit C**: `hello.txt` file is deleted.

At the current state, `A---B---C (HEAD)`, the `hello.txt` file has been deleted by commit C.

---

### After running `git revert C`:
`git revert C` will create a new commit that undoes the changes made in commit C. Since commit C deleted the `hello.txt` file, `git revert C` will restore the `hello.txt` file.

- **Resulting commits**: `A---B---C---C' (HEAD)`
  - `C'`: A new commit that undoes the deletion of `hello.txt` from commit C.

#### 1. Working Directory state:
After running `git revert C`, the **working directory** will reflect the state of commit B, meaning the `hello.txt` file will be restored.

- **Files in the working directory**:
  - `.gitignore` (created in commit A).
  - `hello.txt` (restored, content: "hello").
  - `world.txt` (content: "World", created in commit B).

#### 2. Staging Area state:
When `git revert` creates a new commit, the changes it makes (in this case, restoring `hello.txt`) are automatically staged and committed. Therefore, after running `git revert C`, the **staging area** will be clean, with no changes left to stage.

- **Staging area status**:
  - No changes pending for commit, as all files are committed.
  - The `hello.txt` file will be restored and staged properly.

---

### Summary

- **Commit history**: `A---B---C---C' (HEAD)`
  - A new commit `C'` is created to restore the `hello.txt` file.

- **Working Directory**:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `hello.txt` (restored, content: "hello")
  - `world.txt` (content: "World")

- **Staging Area**:
  - All files are staged and committed (including the restored `hello.txt`).

In conclusion, `git revert C` reverts the repository to the state of commit B by restoring the `hello.txt` file and creating a new commit `C'` that reflects this restoration.

---

### Conflict scenario with git revert

In some cases, reverting a commit can cause conflicts if there are subsequent commits that modify the same file. Let’s consider the following scenario:

### Scenario setup:
- **Commit A**: Initial state (no changes).
- **Commit B**: `hello.txt` file is created (content: "hello").
- **Commit C**: `hello.txt` file is modified (content: "hello world").
- **Commit D**: `hello.txt` file is further modified (content: "hello world good").

At the current state, `A---B---C---D (HEAD)`, the `hello.txt` file contains "hello world good".

---

### After running `git revert C`:

Running `git revert C` will attempt to undo the changes made in commit C, meaning it will try to change the content of `hello.txt` back from "hello world" to "hello". However, since **commit D** has already modified the file to "hello world good", this may cause a conflict.

#### Conflict details:
- **Revert action**: `git revert C` will try to change the file content from "hello world" back to "hello".
- **Current state**: The file content in `hello.txt` is now "hello world good", which was modified in commit D.

This difference between what `git revert C` wants to do (revert to "hello") and the current state of the file (which is "hello world good") causes a **conflict**.

#### Conflict message:
Git will provide a conflict message like:
```bash
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.txt
```

Opening the `hello.txt` file will show the conflict markers:
```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
hello world good
=======
hello
>>>>>>> revert C
```

You will need to manually resolve the conflict by deciding whether to keep "hello", "hello world good", or some combination of both.

#### Conflict resolution steps:
1. Manually edit `hello.txt` to resolve the conflict.
2. Stage the file using:
```bash
git add hello.txt
```
3. Commit the resolved conflict:
```bash
git commit
```

---

### Summary of conflict scenario

- **Commit history before revert**: `A---B---C---D (HEAD)`
- **After revert**: 
  - Git attempts to revert commit C, but since commit D modified the same file, a conflict arises.
  - The conflict must be manually resolved before proceeding.
